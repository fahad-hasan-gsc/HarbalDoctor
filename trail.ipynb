They have made \\nsignificant contribution to human health through their health promotive, \\ncurative and rehabilitative properties and in the prevention of illnesses. \\nIndeed, many herbal remedies used traditionally have become modern \\nmedicines through drug development. Digoxin, morphine, colchicine, and \\nartemisinin are some notable examples. Long tradition of use of many \\nherbal remedies and experiences passed on from generation to generation \\nhas brought about reliance by the people on herbal remedies. At present, \\nthe use of medicinal plants for health benefits is increasing worldwide.\\nThis publication contains 28 monographs on common ailments which \\ncan be readily treated with simple herbal remedies. They can be prepared \\neasily and used within the ambit of primary health care. Each monograph \\nprovides description of the ailment, the form of traditional preparation, its \\ncomposition, English name, Latin name and family of the plant, plant part \\nused, main chemical constituents, quality standards, method of \\npreparation, dosage form, therapeutic properties, indications and uses, \\ndose and mode of administration, precautions and safety aspects, and \\nimportant references.\\nIt is an attempt to promote the rational, safe and appropriate use of \\nherbal medicines and mainstreaming of traditionally used herbal \\nremedies. This manual can be used by health planners, policy makers, \\nnational and district health authorities and others involved in the health \\nsector development and reform. It is also an attempt to increase \\navailability and accessibility to cost-effective treatment of commonly \\nencountered health problems with herbal remedies. It will be useful for \\neducation and training of community health workers as well. These efforts \\nwould eventually promote 'health for all' in the context of primary health \\ncare.\\nTraditional Herbal Remedies\\nfor Primary Health Care\\nTraditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care\"),\n",

Gastric acidity and inflammation of the stomach is called gastritis, \\nwhich produces a common symptom of burning sensation in the middle \\npart of the upper half of the abdomen, while acid reflux causes throat \\nand heartburn and delayed gastric emptying with fermentation leads \\nto gaseous distension of abdomen and belching. These abnormalities \\nlead to symptoms like nausea, loss of appetite, indigestion and mild \\nto moderate upper abdominal pain and distress.\\n Frequent dietary irregularities and ingestion of irritant materials \\nlike too spicy and sour foods, alcohol and analgesic drugs like \\naspirin are the common causes of acidity and gastritis.

Generally, frequency of bowel \\nevacuation varies from person to person. As per a person’s tendency, \\nlifestyle and dietary habit, frequency of defecation of 1-2 per day to \\nthrice a week is considered as normal bowel habit for that individual, \\nunless it creates any discomfort or disturbs his routine life. The volume \\nof stool passed differs greatly in different races.\\nUnsatisfactory bowel evacuation is the chief condition for diagnosis \\nof constipation. Some other symptoms which accompany or result from \\nconstipation are indigestion, flatulence, abdominal pain or discomfort, \\nheadache and sleeplessness. The retention of hard faecal masses \\nmay give rise to spurious diarrhoea and in extreme situations can \\nlead to intestinal obstruction especially in frail and bed-ridden older \\nindividuals.\\nVarious causative factors for constipation are given below.\\nIrritable bowel syndrome(1) \\nRelated to diet factors:(2) \\nToo bland food, e.g. with low fibre residue• \\nToo dry and astringent food• \\nInadequate fluid intake• \\nIntake of hard water(3) \\nMetabolic disease like hypothyroidism(4) \\nHaritaki powder for constipation\\n4'),\n",

It is a \\nmajor symptom and sign of serious disease of many organ systems; \\nmost important among them being the liver. Jaundice is often \\nassociated with yellow urination which reflects excessive excretion \\nof bilirubin in the urine as well. There is a direct correlation between \\nthe blood levels of bilirubin and the extent of tissue discoloration.\\nJaundice reflects a deranged state of bilirubin metabolism. \\nBilirubin is a waste product produced in the body from the globin \\npart of haemoglobin, which is released from the destruction of old \\nred blood cells and remains in the blood after iron is removed. It is \\nthe liver that is responsible to remove bilirubin from the blood by \\nconjugating it and then secreting bilirubin containing bile into the \\nintestine via bile ducts. Jaundice may result from the following three \\nmain conditions:\\nDue to over-production of bilirubin exceeding the capacity of (1) \\nthe liver to remove it from the blood. This kind of jaundice \\nis found in excessive breakdown of red blood cells due to \\ntheir defective formation, or due to the effect of toxins or \\ncertain drugs when a large amount of bilirubin is released \\ninto blood.\\nDue to functional disturbance of the liver that prevents removal, (2) \\nconversion and secretion of bilirubin. It is characteristic of \\nhepatitis.\\nDue to blockage of the bile ducts causing reduced flow of (3) \\nbile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines. It is seen \\nin conditions in which bile ducts get obstructed due to gall \\nstones, cancer or inflammation.\\nKatuka powder for jaundice\\n14'),\n",

The \\nliver may be slightly enlarged and tender. The stool may be light in \\ncolour but the urine is yellow. In haemolytic jaundice, the patient \\nsuffers from anaemia and both the urine and stool are of orange \\ncolour. In jaundice caused by blockage of the bile ducts, bile does \\nnot enter the intestines so there is impairment of fat digestion and \\nabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. This condition leads to fatty stools \\nand deficiency symptoms of fat-soluble vitamins. The stool is clay-\\ncoloured in obstructive jaundice because of the absence of bilirubin \\nthat normally gives stool its brown colour. A troublesome symptom \\nfound in patients with this type of jaundice is itching, which may be \\nas severe as to cause scratching and disturbed sleep.\\nThe patient’s history can suggest the possible cause for jaundice. \\nFor example, excessive use of alcohol is suggestive of alcoholic liver \\ndisease, whereas use of hepatotoxic drugs suggests drug-toxicity-\\ninduced jaundice and sharing of syringes for injection of drugs points \\ntowards viral hepatitis. Attacks of abdominal pain in a patient with \\njaundice suggests blockage of the bile ducts usually by gallstones. \\nBulky and clay coloured stools and dark urine suggests obstruction \\nin the passage of bile.\\nJudicious use of Katuka powder along with necessary dietary \\nprecautions can successfully treat uncomplicated jaundice.\\nKatuka (Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth.)\\nKatuka is a perennial hairy herb grown in alpine regions with \\ntemperate climatic conditions. The medicinal plant in Indian medicine \\nis named as Katuka or Katuki owing to its immense bitter taste. The \\nrhizome of the plant is a bitter tonic used for the treatment of febrile \\nand liver disorders. Uses of Katuka are documented in the ancient \\nclassical texts – Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. Most of \\nthe Ayurvedic remedies described in literature and commercially \\nmanufactured for jaundice and liver disorders essentially contain \\nKatuka as one of the ingredients. Katuka and its formulations find \\nmention in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and the Ayurvedic Formulary \\nof India. Apart from highly preferred use of Katuka in the treatment \\nof jaundice and related diseases by Indian practitioners, scientific \\nstudies have established that it has an anti-inflammatory property, \\nprovides liver protection and improves bilirubin excretion.'),\n",

It generally \\ninvolves big weight-bearing joints such as the knee, hip, spine but \\nin women it may involve the terminal joints of the fingers. The \\npatients are frequently obese. Pain in joints initially is intermittent \\nand appears after using the joints and is relieved by rest.

Crepitus are felt or heard in the affected joints. \\nBony outgrowth may appear on the joint margins. \\nGouty arthritis is a form of arthritis which is caused by \\naccumulation of uric acid crystals inside the joint which evokes an \\nacute inflammatory response. It is one of the most painful joint \\ndiseases.

The lice are small wingless parasites with sucking mouth \\nparts that feed on human blood and lay their eggs on body hairs \\nor in clothing. Lice infestation itself is not dangerous but a serious \\npublic health problem because some lice can carry microorganisms \\nthat cause diseases like relapsing fever, trench fever and epidemic \\ntyphus.\\nLice infestation usually occurs due to poor upkeep and hygiene \\nof hairy body parts for want of adequate facilities for bathing and \\nwashing of clothes, particularly undergarments. Any individual could \\nget lice infestation; children with long hair are however more prone \\nto suffer. \\nThe most common site for lice infestation is the scalp, and it \\nis transmitted from one person to another by close contact and by \\nsharing of combs and hair brushes. Head lice infestation in epidemic \\nform is common in school-going children. Adult lice can be seen on \\nthe patient’s scalp close to the base of hairs and around the ears and \\nthese may spread from the scalp to the eyebrows, eyelashes, and \\nbeard in adults, although they are more often limited to the scalp \\nin children. Grayish-white eggs called nits may also be visible along \\nwith lice. Nits are premature forms of lice, which take 3 to 14 days to \\nhatch. Infestations of body lice and pubic lice are seen in individuals \\nwho maintain poor personal hygiene, wear the same clothes and vests \\ncontinuously without laundering, do not bathe regularly and share \\nbedding or clothes or towels with infected persons.\\nDhattura paste for lice infestation\\n17'),\n",

The itching may be intense, and may be followed by \\nbacterial infection of skin that has been scratched open. The itching \\nresults from an allergic reaction to a toxin that is present in the \\nsaliva of the lice. Diffuse skin eruption or inflammation can result \\nwith repeated bites of lice.\\nAnother common complication in head lice infestation is swelling \\nor inflammation of the neck glands. Patients with body lice often have \\nintense itching with deep scratches around the folds of shoulders, \\nflanks or neck. The bites first appear as small red pimples but may \\ncause a generalized skin rash. If the infestation is not treated, the \\npatient may develop complications that include headache, fever, and \\nbacterial infection with scarring.

The initial phase of infestation is asymptomatic. Subsequently, \\nthe disease manifests with intense itching especially at night or while \\ntaking a hot water bath. The itching is due to allergic reaction to the \\nmites and their excreta or deposit in skin burrows. The skin lesion \\nincludes red rashes and raised spots. Due to scratching the skin may \\nbecome crusty or scaly as the infection progresses. Early scabies \\nrash may show little red bumps like hives, pimples and tiny bites. \\nScabies usually begins in the body’s folds and crevices such as arm \\npits, around the nipples of women, on the penis of men, belt line, \\nbetween the fingers, buttocks, elbows, inner thighs, wrist, and skin \\nunder rings, bracelets or watch bands.

Long tradition of use of many \\nherbal remedies and experiences passed on from generation to generation \\nhas brought about reliance by the people on herbal remedies. At present, \\nthe use of medicinal plants for health benefits is increasing worldwide.\\nThis publication contains 28 monographs on common ailments which \\ncan be readily treated with simple herbal remedies. They can be prepared \\neasily and used within the ambit of primary health care. Each monograph \\nprovides description of the ailment, the form of traditional preparation, its \\ncomposition, English name, Latin name and family of the plant, plant part \\nused, main chemical constituents, quality standards, method of \\npreparation, dosage form, therapeutic properties, indications and uses, \\ndose and mode of administration, precautions and safety aspects, and \\nimportant references.\\nIt is an attempt to promote the rational, safe and appropriate use of \\nherbal medicines and mainstreaming of traditionally used herbal \\nremedies. This manual can be used by health planners, policy makers, \\nnational and district health authorities and others involved in the health \\nsector development and reform. It is also an attempt to increase \\navailability and accessibility to cost-effective treatment of commonly \\nencountered health problems with herbal remedies. It will be useful for \\neducation and training of community health workers as well.
